# Coffee Story


This is a site programmed to help educate and navigate you in your journey through the world of coffee. You may select whatever part of the page you'd like to read about and jump there using the "Find Out More!" button. 

You can also look through coffee recipes depending on whether you like drinking your coffee hot or cold. Just select either "hot" or "cold" and press "Find Me A Recipe!".

Under the recipe option I'm using the google maps api to help navigate the user to the closest coffee shop to them. After allowing the page to use your geolocation, you can search for nearby cafes simply by using the search bar. 

To find out more about how I put it together feel free to check out my blog post:
