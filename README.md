# CoffeeStory


This is a site programmed to help teach you about the world of coffee. You may select whatever part of the page you'd like to read about and jump there using the "Find Out More!" button. 

You can also look through coffee recipes depending on whether you like drinking your coffee hot or cold. 

Under the recipe option I'm using the google maps api to help navigate the user to the closest coffee shop to them. After allowing the page to use your geolocation, you can search for cafes simply by using the search bar.
